## What is ERC404Pro?

ERC404Pro is an open, mixed ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC1155 implementation designed to provide native fractionalization while supporting seamless integration with existing protocols.

But it is different from the [ERC404](https://github.com/Pandora-Labs-Org/erc404), it use a different logic about NFT / FT swap that bring the duality of NFT / FT to your NFT projects.

IXOProtocol is an implementation of the ERC404Pro.

## How it works in $IXOProtocol?

1. We have 10K $XRC721 NFT in total for our platform, project owner can buy the $XRC721 NFT, then they can use it to init their $XRC1155 project.

2. Every $XRC1155 project contain `10K NFT` or `10K * ftSwapUnit $FT`, it means 1 NFT can swap with`ftSwapUnit $FT`.

3. It mixed ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC1155 implementation designed to provide a liquidity for every NFT project.

## $XRC1155

$XRC721 can start IXO via sold $XRC1155 which has the duality of NFT and FT. User can swap 10K FT to get 1 NFT, or swap 1 NFT to get 10K FT.
Launchpad $XRC1155 new project launch here, It's the feed stream for IXO events, providing a platform for users to discover high-quality $XRC721 projects.

## Grid

All 10K $XRC721 NFT list on the grid that provides a visual map for our users, it can provide a farm function to generate profit from traffic.

## UI/UX

The project provides a beautiful and concise user UI/UX, and the $IXOProtocol supported behind it makes this beautifully introduced interface have a truly valuable function: the FT/NFT project token Launchpad

## Features

$IXOProtocol helps old NFT projects reactivate their liquidity (of course, new projects can also be launched directly on it).
Its unique FT/NFT duality will be extremely attractive to value projects, helping project parties better distribute their tokens/NFT while providing better liquidity to their users.
